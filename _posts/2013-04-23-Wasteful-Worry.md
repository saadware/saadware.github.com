Compared to last year's Winter/Spring, which was super dry, Boulder, 
Colorado is seeing its fair share of precipitation. Each of the last 
three weeks started off with a massive piling of snow on the
Monday/Tuesday, followed by a warming trend all the way up until
the weekend where temperates were in the 60's! Then, the cycle starts
over again with snow. Very twisty indeed and I think it's causing
everyone around here to go a bit Spring Crazy.

With the snow starting early yesterday morning it took the entire
city by surprise when the flakes didn't stop flying until mid 
afternoon today! Even the city's road cleaning crew seemed to be
extremely behind this morning as the slush was piling high and
cars were more of a mess than I've seen them in quite some time. 

Yeah... I'm talking about weather here. There is a point... I swear. 
Bear with me...

While my wife and I were racing to drive our kids to school, a
little Subaru (Boulder's signature car), pulled out in front
of me. Now I'm not one to get *the rage* or anything 
but it did strike me as odd. While I was Northbound, this 
person cut across two lanes of traffic to make a left turn in 
front of me, coming extremely close to making the Southbound traffic
slide into them (you know... 'cause it was wicked snowy out and all).

Here's the thing. If the person would have waited just an extra
five seconds, they would have realized that both Southbound and 
Northbound traffic was clear, giving them the worry free right-of-way.

The event sparked a thought in my head. This person could not
see there was an opening in traffic. Under the duress and worry of 
a stressful snowy commute an interesting decision was made to risk
basic safety. Of course in hindsight, there wasn't anything to rush
about and the safety shouldn't have been compromised because traffic
cleared within seconds.

As humans it's natural for us to see the events in real time, not 
fulling understanding them and therefore getting anxious about possible 
outcomes. 

We worry. We worry like no other. We worry about what's going
to happen and for what? What can our worry possibly gain us? It's not
like by worrying we can have a better control over a situation. 

How many times have been anxious about something happening but the
thing did not even end up happening? I think it's safe to say that
this happens and controls most of us. 

If we stop and think about this for a bit, we might realize that an
exorbitant amount of energy is put into this worry crap, which ends
up having zero payoff. When there is no payoff, one could argue
that the energy went to waste. 

**I hate waste.**

I hate wasting my time. I hate putting in effort where I 
know there is going to be no foreseeable benefit. Frankly, it pisses 
me off.

What better things could we being doing with our minds if they weren't
consumed by endless worry? Only one could imagine and I would have to 
think we could put it to better use. 

The whole experience reminds me of a story I once heard.

While a wise man was on his deathbed he confessed to his Father, "Father.", 
he said. "I've lived a very hard life." He continued, "Most
of which has not even happened."

So how much of our life is spent in this worry? How much of our lives 
are we wasting on thoughts that won't even happen? Maybe if we try
and put our attention on other things, our worries might start to 
melt away. Perhaps.

Like the anxiety of the snowy driver that almost caused an 
unnecessary accident because they didn't see that *everything was 
okay*, we don't see what's going to happen next in our lives. 
By thinking with an optimistic point of view we might find that 
more times than not, it's all going to be okay if we just wait 
the extra time and see. 

Put your energy were it counts. We only have so much to give.
