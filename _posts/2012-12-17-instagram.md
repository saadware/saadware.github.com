About a month ago I decided to open up an [Instagram](http://instagram.com) 
account. It seemed like another interesting outlet for social interaction. 
I mainly was looking for a way to put my fairly new iPhone 5 to use as a 
camera. 

When Instagram stopped showing up in Twitter feeds, the value immediately 
diminished and have since not used it. The final straw was drawn with recent 
[terms of service announcements](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/17/instagrams-terms-of-service_n_2317402.html),

Needless to say, I'm not sad about moving away. It's definitely interesting
though. I pulled the plug on a [similar service](http://facebook.com) about 
four years ago for like reasons.

This is just it... there exists a fine line in ad supported services. If
a company is not careful there ways can start to seem dirty and wrong. 
It's possible that my feelings are in the minority but I feel that if a 
service is good enough, users find a way to pay it.

I love me some filters and I'm happy Twitter is now natively providing 
features like what Instagram brought. And I suppose I could always rekindle 
the love for my [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/saadsj/) account 
that I've happily been paying for since 2008.
