While reading 
[this article](http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2012/12/18/maya_apocalypse_2012_doomsday_end_of_the_world_prophecies_are_nonsense.html) 
about the absurdity of 2012 doomsday apocalypse, there were a few pieces 
that caused me to chuckle and therefore felt I should capture. 

It was written by fellow Boulderite, Phil Plait, also knows as 
[@BadAstronomer](https://twitter.com/BadAstronomer).

Some words on Planet X: 

> Back in 2003, there was a big doomsday rumor flying around the web 
> about a giant planet named Nibiru (or, more ominously, Planet X) 
> that orbits the Sun every 3600 years. On May 15 of that year, so 
> it was said, the planet would sweep past the Earth and cause all 
> sorts of disasters. A lot of people really believed it, too.

He then goes on to say: 

> You may remember that date as being one when the Earth wasn't
> destroyed.

Yes... I totally LOL'd on that one.

The humor continues: 

> I suspect they *wouldn't* have known about Nibiru even if it did 
> exist. And of course, they never mentioned it. Because it 
> *didn't*. Exist, I mean.

The article continues and is a good read. Consider me a fan. 

Don't get me wrong. I think it's natural human instinct to have
glimpses of, "Oh wait. Crap! What if there is some truth to this 
doomsday business?" It's in our nature to worry about things 
outside of our control, no matter how logical we may be. I admit 
that I have too.

Outside of the fear being spread, December 21, 2012 is gearing
up to be a regular day here on earth. If anything, I hope the 
big surprise is that it ends up snowing. Like a mother load 
snow is dropped from the heavens. 

Bring on the snowpocalypse.
