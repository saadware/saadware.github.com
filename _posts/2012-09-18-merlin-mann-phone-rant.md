For my own humor I had to capture the latest rant by 
[Merlin Mann](http://twitter.com/hotdogsladies) regarding a mobile 
phone. The series of tweets were a bundle of laughs for me.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p>Maybe a healthy step would be to establish—just for yourself—how many people need to publicly agree you’ve ordered the nicest mobile phone.</p>&mdash; Merlin Mann (@hotdogsladies) <a href="https://twitter.com/hotdogsladies/status/248270686072758273" data-datetime="2012-09-19T04:01:58+00:00">September 19, 2012</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p>I bet a lot of people won’t admit they already KNOW you ordered the nicest mobile phone.They should admit your mobile phone is the nicest.</p>&mdash; Merlin Mann (@hotdogsladies) <a href="https://twitter.com/hotdogsladies/status/248274402528088064" data-datetime="2012-09-19T04:16:44+00:00">September 19, 2012</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p>Because, seriously—friend to friend?You’ve ordered a really, really, REALLY nice mobile phone.Eventually, everyone will publicly agree.</p>&mdash; Merlin Mann (@hotdogsladies) <a href="https://twitter.com/hotdogsladies/status/248275072287133696" data-datetime="2012-09-19T04:19:24+00:00">September 19, 2012</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p>No. Seriously. I’m not even kidding here.You’ve ordered a really REALLY nice mobile phone.Now, try to get some sleep. You’ve earned it.</p>&mdash; Merlin Mann (@hotdogsladies) <a href="https://twitter.com/hotdogsladies/status/248277622453317632" data-datetime="2012-09-19T04:29:32+00:00">September 19, 2012</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p>Sh-sh-shhhh!I know—just close your eyes, lay very still, and try not to think about your mobile phone.You can win again in the morning.</p>&mdash; Merlin Mann (@hotdogsladies) <a href="https://twitter.com/hotdogsladies/status/248279935729401856" data-datetime="2012-09-19T04:38:44+00:00">September 19, 2012</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p>Theeeeeere we go.Good night.</p>&mdash; Merlin Mann (@hotdogsladies) <a href="https://twitter.com/hotdogsladies/status/248284947020906497" data-datetime="2012-09-19T04:58:38+00:00">September 19, 2012</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p>Ssssssshhhhhh…<a href="http://t.co/vJJgyd11" title="http://mlkshk.com/r/JHL2.png">mlkshk.com/r/JHL2.png</a></p>&mdash; Merlin Mann (@hotdogsladies) <a href="https://twitter.com/hotdogsladies/status/248285131587084288" data-datetime="2012-09-19T04:59:22+00:00">September 19, 2012</a></blockquote>

And that is all. At least for now.
