<p>Recently I was <a title="Windows 3.1 Released" target="_blank" href="http://www.computerhistory.org/tdih/April/6/">reminded</a> about some of my early computing adventures. While my earliest memories were that of playing games on an my neighbor&#8217;s Apple IIe, most of my early adolescence was spent in front of an unknown AT&amp;T PC running DOS. No, I don&#8217;t remember specifics on hardware or OS version. </p>

<p>Countless hours wer spent just messing with the thing, from both the hardware and software side. I would break it to the point where it no longer would boot, attempt to fix, fail at that, call technical support to get it fixed. It&#8217;s easy to say that I had no idea what I was doing, but enjoyed it. Pure exploration&#8230; one of the few things in my early life that I did explore outside of sports. </p>

<p>Athletics dominated the majority of my extra curricular activities growing up and it wasn&#8217;t until 10th grade when I embarked upon my first programming class. Sports and general studies came easy to me. Programming, I had to work at. I had to bend my mind in ways to make the computer do things I wasn&#8217;t sure how it might go about doing. I literally would spend hours trying to wrap my head around loops so that I could alternate the red and white stripes of the American flag as I flailed to draw it to the screen.</p>

<p>Programming was fun but wasn&#8217;t something I dedicated too much time to outside of class. However, it perked enough interest for me to apply to the Computer Science Department at the University of Colorado. I remember looking down a list of possible areas of study when applying and seeing the words &#8220;computer&#8221; and &#8220;science&#8221; and then thinking to myself, &#8220;Hey, I like computers&#8230; and science is pretty cool!&#8221; </p>

<p>I honestly had no clue what I was getting myself into at the time. The thought of using programming to solve scientific problems didn&#8217;t even cross my mind. Yes, naive is an understatement. All I knew is that I wanted to do something with computers. That was it. The rest I would figure out when I got there.</p>
