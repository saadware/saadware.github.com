<blockquote>Give just a little bit more<br/>

Take a little bit less<br/>

From each other tonight<br/>

Admit what you&#8217;re feeling<br/>

And see what&#8217;s in front of you,<br/>

It&#8217;s never out of your sight.<br/>

You know it&#8217;s true,<br/>

We all know that it&#8217;s true.</blockquote>&#8212;<a href="http://rd.io/x/QOmoK2i7pA" title="Song on Rdio" target="_blank">The Moody Blues - Never Comes The Day</a>
