<blockquote><p>Come, said my soul, <br/>

Such verses for my Body let us write, (for we are one,) <br/>

That should I after return, Or, long, long hence, in other spheres, <br/>

There to some group of mates the chants resuming, <br/>

(Tallying Earth&#8217;s soil, trees, winds, tumultuous waves,) <br/>

Ever with pleas&#8217;d smile I may keep on, <br/>

Ever and ever yet the verses owningâ€”as, first, I here and now <br/>

Signing for Soul and Body, set to them my name, </p>



<p>Walt Whitman</p></blockquote>&#8212;Walt Whitman. Leaves of Grass
