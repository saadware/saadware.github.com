Dreaming.

This means something.

I'm part of an audience, watching horror unfold.

The crowd claps at acts I find repulsive.

What is happening?

What just happened?

More cheers, more unthinkable acts.

I don't know if this is OK.

Is this OK?

Why do I feel so uneasy?

This is life.

Somebody stop this guy!

Why is everyone else calm?

I need to realize.

Wakeup.

This is just a dream.

Is this life?

Relax, it will all be over in time.

Breath.
