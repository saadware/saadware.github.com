<p>Dreaming.</p>

<p>This means something.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m part of an audience, watching horror unfold.</p>

<p>The crowd claps at acts I find repulsive. </p>

<p>What is happening? </p>

<p>What just happened?</p>

<p>More cheers, more unthinkable acts. </p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know if this is OK.</p>

<p>Is this OK?</p>

<p>Why do I feel so uneasy?</p>

<p>This is life. </p>

<p>Somebody stop this guy!</p>

<p>Why is everyone else calm?</p>

<p>I need to realize.</p>

<p>Wakeup.</p>

<p>This is just a dream.</p>

<p>Is this life?</p>

<p>Relax, it will all be over in time. </p>

<p>Breath.</p>
