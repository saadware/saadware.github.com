<p>I used to be a huge fan of my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moleskine" target="_blank">Moleskine</a>. I still am, but I guess I used to be a <em>huger</em> fan?</p>

<p>Apparently some <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2245560" target="_blank">like minded geeks</a> feel it&#8217;s an important tool. My main complaint is that I cannot read my chicken scratch handwriting and have therefore opted to use the <a href="http://www.evernote.com" target="_blank">Evernote</a> service (paid subscriber) for a lot of my day-to-day thought captures.</p>



<p>However, I do still use my notebook in low-tech scenarios when a lot of my creative thinking seems to be done&#8230; away from computers/devices.</p>
