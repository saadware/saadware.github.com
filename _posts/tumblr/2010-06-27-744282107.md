I have moved my blog to a new home (tumblr) and am hoping my [rss
feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/saadware) just works so that my one
subscriber (hi mom!) has no problems. Tumblr just seemed simpler and I didn't
need all the tricked out options that wordpress gave me. Too many
distractions. Hopefully this change will help motivate more writing.

[blog.saadware.com](http://blog.saadware.com) will stay around for archival
purposes.
