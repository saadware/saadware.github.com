I've taken a good break from many online interactions (blogging, twitter,
etc). It's been a nice interruption indeed as I found it has truly helped me
refocus.

This wasn't the first time I've done this and it probably won't be the last.
Each time I do it, something new is learned about where distractions live for
me; the net gains of participating in these games; how my priorities need to
shift to meet my objectives.

When taking such extended breaks from my twitter stream, I've been asked if
it's because I don't like it. I do like it. I find it very entertaining!
However, up to this point that's all I've realized. It's another form of
entertainment. That in itself has value but has to be equally weighed against
the more pressing things in my life, whatever those might be at a given time.

As we know, our time is finite and for me twitter has a cost. For example, I
tend to obsess about how I write something: delivery, humor, seriousness,
thoughtfulness, geek value, etc. This obsession takes time, but I do enjoy
doing it. It's just that my priorities need to be better kept in check as I
don't gain anything from it, regardless of how I try to spin it to myself.

So… until next time I introvert… I'm back!
