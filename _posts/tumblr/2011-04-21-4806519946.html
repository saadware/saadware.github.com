<p><strong>Coder 1</strong>: Hey there! Noticed you commented out some code with your recent checkin.</p>

<p><strong>Coder 2</strong>: Yes, the code was ancient and not even being used anymore. I whacked it! <strong>&lt;karate chop motion&gt;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Coder 1</strong>: Well, you commented it out and then added your own comment about why you commented it out.</p>

<p><strong>Coder 2</strong>: Yes&#8230;?</p>

<p><strong>Coder 1</strong>: &#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Coder 2</strong>: What?</p>

<p><strong>Coder 1</strong>: Why didn&#8217;t you just delete the old code and be done?</p>

<p><strong>Coder 2</strong>: Then the future maintainers of it wouldn&#8217;t realize what I had done.</p>

<p><strong>Coder 1</strong>: But we&#8217;re using source control management&#8230; history is preserved for you!</p>

<p><strong>Coder 2</strong>: I know, but how would they <em>really</em> know? You know?</p>

<p><strong>Coder 1</strong>: &#8230; <strong>&lt;karate chop motion&gt;</strong></p>
