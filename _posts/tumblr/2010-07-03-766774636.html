<p>I&#8217;ve been riding the converted single speed mountain bike for the past week. It&#8217;s been nice switch from the more sleek road bike. When on the road bike I am determined to get to my destination (work/home) in the fastest manner. I crank, pretty hard. However, one can only go so fast when on a single speed and therefore, this forced me to <em>slow down</em>.</p>



<p>It forced me to look more horizontally, much like a real commute should be where one enjoys not only the ride, but the surroundings as well. I tend to mess around more as well, hopping on/off curbs, riding wheelies, etc. I feel more like a kid, careless and enjoying the moment.</p>



<p>I know I&#8217;ll switch back over to the speedster at some point, but I&#8217;ve enjoyed the change.</p>
