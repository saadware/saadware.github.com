If you are using the hot new [grove.io](http://grove.io) irc service for your
development team chatter and also use [Perforce](http://perforce.com), then
tune in. Using the grove.io API, I've written a script to publish change
commit notifications to an irc channel, kicked off by a [Perforce Trigger](htt
p://www.perforce.com/perforce/doc.current/manuals/cmdref/triggers.html).

The script is written in Python (one of my first adventures in the language so
be gentle) and requires the
[P4Python](http://www.perforce.com/product/components/apis#p4python) hooks to
be present.
