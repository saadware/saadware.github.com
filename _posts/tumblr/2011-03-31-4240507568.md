Things come up.

Everyday, they come up.

It never stops.

How many should I direct my attention toward?

Which ones to ignore?

Which ones are worth my time?

If I try and take them all on I hurt.

I feel spread.

When spread, I cannot focus.

When I cannot focus I feel less content.

I feel like there has to be something else.

Something else to put my attention on.

Will it bring me happiness?

I don't know.

Spreading is not working.

Naturally, I feel down.

Time to reinvent.
