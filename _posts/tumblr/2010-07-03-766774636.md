title: slowing down single speed style

I've been riding the converted single speed mountain bike for the past week.
It's been nice switch from the more sleek road bike. When on the road bike I
am determined to get to my destination (work/home) in the fastest manner. I
crank, pretty hard. However, one can only go so fast when on a single speed
and therefore, this forced me to _slow down_.

It forced me to look more horizontally, much like a real commute should be
where one enjoys not only the ride, but the surroundings as well. I tend to
mess around more as well, hopping on/off curbs, riding wheelies, etc. I feel
more like a kid, careless and enjoying the moment.

I know I'll switch back over to the speedster at some point, but I've enjoyed
the change.
