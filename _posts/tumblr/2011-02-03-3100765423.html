<p>I&#8217;ve taken a good break from many online interactions (blogging, twitter, etc). It&#8217;s been a nice interruption indeed as I found it has truly helped me refocus.</p>



<p>This wasn&#8217;t the first time I&#8217;ve done this and it probably won&#8217;t be the last. Each time I do it, something new is learned about where distractions live for me; the net gains of participating in these games; how my priorities need to shift to meet my objectives.</p>



<p>When taking such extended breaks from my twitter stream, I&#8217;ve been asked if it&#8217;s because I don&#8217;t like it. I do like it. I find it very entertaining! However, up to this point that&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve realized. It&#8217;s another form of entertainment. That in itself has value but has to be equally weighed against the more pressing things in my life, whatever those might be at a given time.</p>



<p>As we know, our time is finite and for me twitter has a cost. For example, I tend to obsess about how I write something: delivery, humor, seriousness, thoughtfulness, geek value, etc. This obsession takes time, but I do enjoy doing it. It&#8217;s just that my priorities need to be better kept in check as I don&#8217;t gain anything from it, regardless of how I try to spin it to myself.</p>



<p>So&#8230; until next time I introvert&#8230; I&#8217;m back!</p>
