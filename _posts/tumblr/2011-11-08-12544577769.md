[Lunch Ride with THE Dude](http://www.flickr.com/photos/saadsj/6327282109/) on
Flickr.

It was a brisk Fall ride, but we hung in there. He had his pretzels, I had my
water. He had his blanket, I had an extra 50 pounds to tote. It was excellent.


We started out heading up the canyon but only got a few miles in when we were
stopped by icy conditions. I therefore turned the ship around and headed North
where I could still hit a few good climbs.

He seemed to enjoy the time. I know I did.
