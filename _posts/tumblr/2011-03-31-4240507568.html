<p>Things come up.</p>

<p>Everyday, they come up.</p>

<p>It never stops.</p>

<p>How many should I direct my attention toward?Â </p>

<p>Which ones to ignore?</p>

<p>Which ones are worth my time?</p>

<p>If I try and take them all on I hurt.</p>

<p>I feel spread.</p>

<p>When spread, I cannot focus.</p>

<p>When I cannot focus I feel less content.</p>

<p>I feel like there has to be something else.</p>

<p>Something else to put my attention on.</p>

<p>Will it bring me happiness?</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know.</p>

<p>Spreading is not working.</p>

<p>Naturally, I feel down.</p>

<p>Time to reinvent.</p>
