<p>A few days ago I had something amusing happen to me on my bike commute into work. Every now and then when stopped at traffic lights I&#8217;ll have the pleasure of talking to people that go out of their way to roll down a window to chit-chat. The conversation usually goes something something like:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Car: Hey, nice bike!</p>

  

  <p>Me: Thanks!</p>

  

  <p>Car: So you like to ride bikes huh?</p>

  

  <p>Me: Yes, it&#8217;s pretty enjoyable.</p>

  

  <p>Car: Sweet!</p>

  

  <p>Me: Yes.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>As you can see, there is not a lot of thought here. My brain pretty much turns into mush as I mindlessly answer some questions within a ten second engagement of dialog. On this particular day there was something about the situation that took me off guard. I&#8217;m still trying to figure out why it went down the way it did. The result was that I proceeded to make an uncontrollable lie which I will never be able to take back.</p>



<p>The first thing that was noticeably different about this experience was that I was not stopped at a traffic light but rather was in motion, on a one way street. The driver, who was in a convertible of some sort, slowed down a bit to get my attention. It went a little something like this:</p>



<blockquote>

  <p>Car: Hey, nice bike!</p>

  

  <p>Me: Thanks!</p>

  

  <p>Car: You like to ride!?!</p>

  

  <p>Me: Yes!</p>

  

  <p>Car: You riding in the Ride the Rockies?</p>

  

  <p>Me: Yes!</p>

  

  <p>Car (passing me, waving happily): Awesome! See you there!</p>

</blockquote>



<p>I have no idea why I said <em>yes</em> to that question. I&#8217;m not riding in this organized event. At some point in my life I may consider it but not anytime soon.</p>



<p>Did I know the person? No.</p>



<p>Did I want to impress the person? I don&#8217;t know why if I did.</p>



<p>Why did I lie?  The only logical reason I can think of is that I <em>panicked</em> because the question took me completely off guard and therefore I said the first thing that was in my line of next answers to come, &#8220;Yes!&#8221;</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t consider myself a pathological lier or even a casual one at that. However, catch me off guard while peddling a two wheeler and who knows what can happen. It&#8217;s just another friendly reminder that I&#8217;m not in control.</p>
