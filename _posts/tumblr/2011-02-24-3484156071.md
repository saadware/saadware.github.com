I used to be a huge fan of my
[Moleskine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moleskine). I still am, but I guess I
used to be a _huger_ fan?

Apparently some [like minded
geeks](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2245560) feel it's an important
tool. My main complaint is that I cannot read my chicken scratch handwriting
and have therefore opted to use the [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com)
service (paid subscriber) for a lot of my day-to-day thought captures.

However, I do still use my notebook in low-tech scenarios when a lot of my
creative thinking seems to be doneâ€¦ away from computers/devices.
