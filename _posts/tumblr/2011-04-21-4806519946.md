**Coder 1**: Hey there! Noticed you commented out some code with your recent checkin.

**Coder 2**: Yes, the code was ancient and not even being used anymore. I whacked it! **(karate chop motion)**

**Coder 1**: Well, you commented it out and then added your own comment about why you commented it out.

**Coder 2**: Yes…?

**Coder 1**: …

**Coder 2**: What?

**Coder 1**: Why didn't you just delete the old code and be done?

**Coder 2**: Then the future maintainers of it wouldn't realize what I had done.

**Coder 1**: But we're using source control management… history is preserved for you!

**Coder 2**: I know, but how would they _really_ know? You know?

**Coder 1**: … **(karate chop motion)**
