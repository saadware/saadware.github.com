title: vim - copying between registers

Many times while in Vim, I like to test out regular expressions that I may use
somewhere else (outside editor, command line, etc). Once I get the expression
working I've sometimes found myself having to retype it into wherever it is I
actually plan to use it.

**A waste of my mother scratchin' time!**

Vim makes heavy use of registers. I recently learned that there is even a
register for the last search preformed (i.e. '/'). Could it be there is also a
register for the clipboard?

The '*'Â register is the clipboard. Now how do I go about copying between these
two registers?

For reference, I found a [handy
Q/A](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1502218/copy-from-one-register-to-
another-vim) on Stack Overflow about this very thing. To copy the last search
expression into the clipboard register one would:

    
    :let @*=@/

Yes. That simple.

Oh Internet, I love thee.
