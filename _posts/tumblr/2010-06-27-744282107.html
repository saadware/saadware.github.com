<p>I have moved my blog to a new home (tumblr) and am hoping my <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/saadware" target="_blank">rss feed</a> just works so that my one subscriber (hi mom!) has no problems. Tumblr just seemed simpler and I didn&#8217;t need all the tricked out options that wordpress gave me. Too many distractions. Hopefully this change will help motivate more writing.</p>



<p><a href="http://blog.saadware.com" target="_blank">blog.saadware.com</a> will stay around for archival purposes.</p>
