<p>It was a brisk Fall ride, but we hung in there. He had his pretzels, I had my water. He had his blanket, I had an extra 50 pounds to tote. It was excellent.<br/><br/> We started out heading up the canyon but only got a few miles in when we were stopped by icy conditions. I therefore turned the ship around and headed North where I could still hit a few good climbs. <br/><br/> He seemed to enjoy the time. I know I did.</p>
