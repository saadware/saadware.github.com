title: Just Write Something
category: misc

Whether it's a [condensed form of expression](https://twitter.com/saadware) 
on my thoughts or something a bit longer, I enjoy writing. There is 
something about the process that brings me satisfaction. 
Unfortunately, I don't carve enough time to do it. 

It's like anything else in life, if you really want to make something
happen, then adjust your priorities to set yourself up for success. At 
this point I'm not sure exactly what I want to *happen* other than
to just write more.

So I will write... more than I have in the past. Starting today. 

One day at a time. Baby steps. 

Where it goes from there I can't really say I care at this point. 

Just write something.
