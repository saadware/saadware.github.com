Last night prior to turning in, I noticed the following tweet come through:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p>We are sad to announce that Grove will be shutting down October 13th. <a href="https://t.co/ispQD80D" title="https://grove.io/blog/grove-shutting-down-october-13">grove.io/blog/grove-shuâ€¦</a></p>&mdash; Grove (@groveio) <a href="https://twitter.com/groveio/status/247190702038056960" data-datetime="2012-09-16T04:30:30+00:00">September 16, 2012</a></blockquote>

[Grove](http://grove.io) is a hosted service that aims at helping 
teams communicate more effectively with their IRC based product, which
includes a fancy web client. They did so by attempting to take the 
somewhat over complications that can come with traditional IRC networks.

I signed our team up when Grove first went to beta and shortly 
thereafter converted to paying customer. Prior to this we were using an
internal IRC server where a VPN connection was required to connect
to it. We needed our chats private and closed off to the rest of 
the public so a traditional IRC network like 
[freenode](http://freenode.net) was not an option. Plus, as our
team became spread across the country, connecting to a VPN seemed 
kind of overkill. 

As I started seeking out other options I heard about this up and 
coming service called Grove. I believe it crossed my eyes one day
on twitter, though I cannot fully recall. It seemed like a perfect 
solution as it not only provided a simple web client to connect with,
it also supported traditional IRC clients, a huge geek selling point.
Another cool feature was a searchable log of all chat history. 
It seemed to be a match made in heaven.

At some point though the honeymoon phase started to fade out. As our
team grew to embrace the service the stability of it started to dwindle.
The system started to have all sorts of connectivity issues where 
minutes, sometimes hours, would go by where we could not use it. 

Doing a little research on the company I knew it was a small team and 
it seemed, like many startups, that engineer(s) were the first line of 
support. Their response time was pretty good given the circumstances 
but as the stability continued to fade, so did my patience.

Eventually I started to look elsewhere and within a week made a
choice to abandon Grove in favor of 
[HipChat](http://www.hipchat.com). For the most part it had the same
selling features (minus the support for traditional IRC clients). 
We've yet to have any troubles with the service. It's been solid.

Ultimately only the company knows why Grove is 
[shutting down](https://grove.io/blog/grove-shutting-down-october-13).

Shutting down a company with paying customers sucks. I have my hunches 
what lead to this but they are purely speculative. Regardless, it
was a fun ride while it lasted and I wish the Grove team all the 
best on their future endeavors.
