    <h1>Scott Saad</h1>

    <p>
    Scott Saad was a former sprinter, footballer, basketballer,
    racquetballer and closet geek (though he didn't know it at the
    time). He has worked for software startups his entire professional
    career. First in creating cutting edge 3D rendering systems at <a
    href="http://anark.com">Anark Corporation</a> (later partially
    acquired by <a href="http://www.nvidia.com">NVIDIA</a>). Next at <a
    href="http://ewsgroup.com">EWS</a> building massive business systems
    that help transform the moving and transportation industry, which
    was acquired by Canadians. 
    
    Currently he's on a solo mission doing some cool programming on big
    time back-end systems in the financial sector. He would explain it
    but would have to swear you to secrecy, which is obviously impossible 
    these days.
    </p>

    <p>
    Scott works, lives and plays in Boulder, Colorado with his beautiful
    wife and three silly kids. He has deep interest in spirituality,
    Waldorf education and how one continually evolves as a human being.
    He enjoys an agile approach to both software development and life.
