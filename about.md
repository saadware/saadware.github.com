    <h1>Scott Saad</h1>

    <p>
    Scott Saad was a former sprinter, footballer, basketballer,
    racquetballer and closet geek (though he didn't know it at the
    time). He has worked for software startups (two to be exact) for his
    entire professional career; first in creating cutting edge 3D
    rendering systems at <a href="http://anark.com">Anark
    Corporation</a> (later partially acquired by <a
    href="http://www.nvidia.com">NVIDIA</a>) and currently at <a
    href="https://ewsgroup.com">EWS</a> building massive business
    systems that help transform the moving and transportation industry. 
    </p>

    <p>
    Scott works, lives and plays in Boulder, Colorado with his beautiful
    wife and three silly kids. He has deep interest in spirituality,
    Waldorf education and how one continually evolves as a human being.
    He enjoys an agile approach to software development as well as life.
